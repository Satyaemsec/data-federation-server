# data-federation-server


express - for creating the server and handling the routing
body-parser - for parsing incoming request bodies
To install these packages, run the following commands in your terminal:


npm install express
npm install body-parser
Once these packages are installed, you can run the Data Federation Server using the node command in your terminal:


node server.js
Here, server.js is the name of the file where you have written the above code. The server will start listening on port 3000, and you can use Postman or any other HTTP client to test it.


A POST route at /federate that receives data from a federated source and adds it to an array called federatedData.
A GET route at /federate that retrieves all federated data in the federatedData array and sends it back as a JSON response.
To test the server, you can use a tool like Postman to make a POST request to http://localhost:3000/federate with some data in the request body. You can then make a GET request to http://localhost:3000/federate to retrieve all federated data.

Note that this is just a simple example, and in a real-world scenario, you would likely need to add more robust error handling, authentication, and other features.
